# js-array-methods

Your task is to re-create the array methods `.forEach`, `.map` and `.filter`.

In `index.js`:
- Fill in the functions forEach, map and filter
- Use for loops inside each of the above functions
- Do not mutate the array that is passed into the function
- Stretch goals:
  - Implement the `.reduce` function & test (pull request please)
  - Ensure the callback functions can access the index and the array itself
